# ProjectSlashDash Game Develop Month (April)

# Requirements 
- [Godot 4.x.x+](https://godotengine.org)

# What was done
- This was a 2D platformer I made in my spare time that taught me a lot about the basics of the Godot game engine to get myself out of tutorial hell. The game is time-trial based and has an intro level, a middle level and an end level. Implied by the project name you can slash and dash through enemies to get the fastest time possible. 

# Controls
- Slash: W key
- Dash: E key
- Jump: Space
- Movement (Arrow keys)

# Background on development
-  This is the first game I've made as well as my first time using the Godot Game engine, traditionally I am a mobile engineer (apps for phones) and have a BS in Computer Science. Coding for a game dev environment can be similar to phone apps in some ways but is mostly very different. You need to think about the art, the music, the physics, the essence of the game itself. The freedom you have to build almost anything in any type of way can be daunting! 

## Challenges as a 1st time game dev
### Figuring out how to make a game fun (still a work in progress)
- Balancing what you know how to build vs what you think is fun within a game vs the time you have to learn new things is a delicate balance. Basically the only way to make more fun games is to make more games so you're comfortable enough to run with interesting out of the box ideas. So that's what I plan on doing. 
### Learning Godot (and why Godot? I never heard of it)
- Godot just seemed to have that perfect balance of a light-weight no nonsense feature set and felt pretty intuitive to me as I kept using it. The node system is very similar to OOP concepts used in mobile development. Basically you want to be able to create things that can be reused both with the UI and the scripts. The Godot engine is also open-source, and whatever you create is yours which is pretty cool. Check out the [Godot Engine docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/about/introduction.html#) if you want to figure this stuff out for yourself. Youtube channels I looked at were [GDQuest](https://www.youtube.com/@Gdquest), [Miziziziz](https://www.youtube.com/@Miziziziz) and [Bitburdy](https://www.youtube.com/@bitbirdy)
